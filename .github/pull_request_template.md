## Test Coverage Analysis

<!--
For user-facing changes we prefer to land the test alongside the code rather
than file a follow-up issue. Think of each new behavior or bug fix as a "user
story" that deserves a regression test. Pick one option per surface; if you
think a test isn't warranted, say why so reviewers can sanity-check.
