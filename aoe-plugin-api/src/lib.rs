//! Plugin manifest types for the Agent of Empires plugin system.
//!
//! This crate is the stable surface a plugin author (and the in-tree host)
//! compiles against: the `aoe-plugin.toml` manifest schema, the capability
//! taxonomy, and the validation rules that gate a manifest before it loads.
//! The contribution sections (capabilities, commands, keybinds, settings,
//! themes, ui, runtime worker) are defined here. Settings and themes are
//! consumed by the Tier 0 registries (#2094); keybinds/commands resolve and
//! graft at Tier 0 but execute only with the runtime host (#2095); ui slots
//! land with #2366. Status and panes are deferred until a consumer exists
//! (#2386). See `docs/development/internals/plugin-system.md`.
