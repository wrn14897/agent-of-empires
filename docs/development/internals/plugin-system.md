# Plugin System Internals

Code-level design for the plugin system (issue #268). This first release ships
only the minimal core: a registry that loads compiled-in first-party plugin
manifests and exposes each one's enabled/disabled state to every surface (CLI,
TUI, web). Contribution registries (settings, keybinds, themes, commands,
status detection, UI slots, panes), the subprocess JSON-RPC worker runtime, the
capability model, external installation, and the supply-chain/trust machinery
are intentionally deferred to follow-up PRs and are not present in the tree yet.

## Manifest schema

`aoe-plugin-api` is the standalone crate that defines the manifest a plugin
ships in `aoe-plugin.toml`. The core schema is just identity:

- `id` (`PluginId`, a validated dotted-lowercase namespace, e.g. `aoe.web`),
- `name`, `version`, `api_version`, and an optional `description`.

`PluginManifest::from_toml_str` pre-checks `api_version` permissively (so a
manifest targeting a newer host reports "upgrade aoe" rather than a confusing
unknown-field error), then parses strictly (`deny_unknown_fields`, so a
contribution section from a future schema is a hard error today) and validates
(`api_version` in range, non-empty `name`/`version`). `API_VERSION` is the
schema/host version this crate understands.

## Registry

`src/plugin/registry.rs` owns the in-process registry.

- `BUILTINS` is a static slice of `BuiltinPlugin`, each embedding its manifest
  TOML via `include_str!`. The `aoe.web` marker is gated on the `serve` cargo
  feature, so it is present in every dashboard/release build and absent from a
  TUI-only build. `default-plugins` (on by default) reserves the on-by-default
  slot for bundled plugins that do not require the dashboard.
- `PluginRegistry::load(config)` parses every builtin manifest, resolves each
  plugin's enabled flag from `[plugins."<id>"]` in `config.toml` (default
  enabled), and collects any parse errors as non-fatal `load_errors`.
- `LoadedPlugin { manifest, enabled }` exposes `id()`, `active()`, and `view()`.

`src/plugin/mod.rs` holds the process-wide `REGISTRY` (an
`RwLock<Option<Arc<PluginRegistry>>>`); `registry()` loads it lazily from the
global config and `reload_registry()` rebuilds it after an enable/disable.

## View model

`src/plugin/view.rs` defines `PluginView { id, name, version, description,
enabled, builtin }`, a `Serialize` struct built straight off `LoadedPlugin`. The
CLI, the TUI plugin manager, and the web dashboard all render from the same
view, so plugin fields are never re-derived per surface.

## Enable/disable

`src/plugin/install::set_enabled(id, enabled)` validates the id against the
registry, writes `[plugins."<id>"].enabled` through the normal `save_config`
path, and reloads the registry. The three surfaces are thin twins over it:

- CLI: `aoe plugin enable|disable` (`src/cli/plugin.rs`).
- TUI: the command-palette / settings-tab plugin manager
  (`src/tui/dialogs/plugin_manager.rs`); the settings tab stages the change and
  persists it on the normal settings save.
- Web: `POST /api/plugins/{id}/enabled`, gated on read-write mode and (when
  login is enabled) an elevated session (`src/server/api/plugins.rs`).

The one behavior wired to a plugin's state today: `aoe serve` refuses to start
while `aoe.web` is disabled (`src/cli/serve.rs`).

## Persisted plugin state (#2091)

Two storage slots hold plugin data on disk ahead of the APIs that read and
write them, so the later API PRs (#2094, #2095) stay focused on behavior:

- **Per-plugin settings.** `PluginConfig.settings` (`src/session/config.rs`) is
  an opaque `toml::Table` persisted as `[plugins."<id>".settings]` in
  `config.toml`. It is kept schema-free on purpose: values survive on disk even
  while the plugin is disabled, and the typed schema that validates and renders
  them arrives with the Tier 0 settings registry (#2094). `enabled` is declared
  before `settings` so the scalar reads above the nested table; the toml
  serializer emits scalars before subtables regardless, so the order is for
  readability. An empty table is omitted.
- **Per-session plugin data.** `Instance.plugin_meta`
  (`src/session/instance.rs`) is a `BTreeMap<String, serde_json::Value>` keyed
  by plugin id, persisted per session in `sessions.json`. Each plugin owns only
  its own slot; data for an uninstalled plugin is retained (cheap, and
  reinstalling restores it). The read/write/cas host API over it
  (`session.meta.{get,set,cas}`) ships with the Tier 1 host (see below).

Both fields are additive (`#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = ...)]`):
absent in older on-disk rows, so they deserialize to empty and need no data
migration.

## Shared substrate

Two neutral modules hold the protocol-agnostic plumbing that both `src/acp/`
and the future plugin host build on, so the host never depends on ACP (the
dependency arrow runs consumer -> substrate):

- `src/process/worker.rs`: worker-subprocess plumbing, process-group
  signalling (terminate/kill/reap), pid liveness, the runner self-inspection
  state machine, and the `<dir>/<id>.{json,sock,log,restart}` path builders.
  The consumer supplies the base directory and a pid extractor for record
  inspection.
- `src/events/`: a durable event-log storage core, a topic-keyed SQLite seq
  log with retention, keyset scans, seq bookkeeping, and attachment blobs over
  opaque JSON payloads. The consumer holds the `Connection` and owns its
  payload type and replay semantics. `acp::event_store::EventStore` is the
  first consumer (`Schema::new("acp")` keeps the existing `acp_events` tables,
  so no migration).

## Contribution schema (#2093)

`PluginManifest` extends past identity to the contribution sections a plugin
declares: `capabilities`, `commands`, `keybinds`, `settings`, `ui`, and a
`runtime` worker entrypoint. These are the sections the first external plugin
declares; they are defined in `aoe-plugin-api` and parsed/validated by the
host, but consumed by later issues (the settings registry in #2094, the runtime
host in #2095, the command/keybind/UI surfaces in #2366). `api_version` is
bumped to 2; an `api_version` 1 manifest still loads. Unknown top-level keys
remain a hard parse error (`deny_unknown_fields`).

The `themes`, `status`, and `panes` sections are deferred until a consumer
exists, so no schema lands in core ahead of one (#2386). With
`deny_unknown_fields`, a manifest declaring `[[themes]]`, `[[status]]`, or
`[[panes]]` is a hard parse error today.

The `runtime` section is one of two kinds: `command` (an argv launched from the
plugin directory) or `release-binary` (a compiled worker shipped as a GitHub
release asset). Installation resolves and downloads a `release-binary` asset;
the Tier 1 host (below) launches and supervises both kinds.

A `command` runtime may declare ordered `[[runtime.build]]` steps, run once at
install and update inside the installed plugin directory before the plugin is
registered. This is how an interpreted worker sets itself up (create a venv,
`pip install`, `npm ci`), so it can then launch via a plugin-relative
`command` that never depends on the daemon's PATH:

```toml
[runtime]
kind = "command"
command = [".venv/bin/aoe-github-worker"]   # plugin-relative: PATH-independent

[[runtime.build]]
command = ["python3", "-m", "venv", ".venv"]

[[runtime.build]]
command = [".venv/bin/pip", "install", "."]
platforms = ["linux", "macos"]              # optional; omitted runs everywhere
```

Each step's argv resolves through the host's argv resolver (bare name on PATH,
separator path relative to the plugin dir, absolute rejected), evaluated just
before the step runs so `.venv/bin/pip` resolves once the prior step created it.
Build steps are free to name bare PATH programs (`python3`, `node`, `uv`): they
run in the user's interactive shell where PATH is reliable, which is exactly why
the worker entrypoint, launched later by the daemon, is not. A step's optional `platforms` (`linux` / `macos` / `windows`)
restricts it to matching hosts. Builds run with cwd set to the plugin dir, with
stdin closed and stdout/stderr inherited so the user sees progress.

Why install time and the final dir, not launch or staging: `aoe plugin
install` runs in the user's interactive shell, where `python3` / `node` / `uv`
are reliably on PATH; the daemon that later launches the worker is not. And a
Python venv is not relocatable (console-script shebangs and `pyvenv.cfg` embed
absolute paths), so the build runs in the final `<plugins_dir>/<id>`, never in
a staging tree that is then renamed. A failed build aborts the install with no
trace; a failed update restores the prior version from a backup, and a leftover
backup from an interrupted update is recovered on the next install/update.

The worker entrypoint (`command`'s `argv[0]`) must be plugin-relative: a path
containing a separator (`.venv/bin/worker`), resolved inside the install
directory. The host enforces this at manifest validation, so the
PATH-independent shape is the default and a bare program name is rejected rather
than silently resolved against whatever PATH the daemon happens to have. An
absolute path is rejected in every mode (it pins a host path).

A worker that genuinely depends on a system tool, for example `command = ["uv",
"run", "worker"]`, opts into that PATH dependency explicitly with `system =
true`:

```toml
[runtime]
kind = "command"
command = ["uv", "run", "worker"]
system = true   # argv[0] is a bare PATH program, resolved at launch
```

`system = true` requires a bare program name (a path is contradictory and
rejected) and moves resolution to launch time against the daemon's PATH. It is
the conscious "I accept the daemon must have this tool" choice, not a fallback a
manifest falls into by naming a program that happens not to be on PATH. Because
its program is resolved at launch, a `system` worker is also not PATH-checked at
install (the install shell's PATH is not the daemon's), so it installs even when
the tool is absent from the install environment.

Two trust notes for build steps. They run as the user, unsandboxed, before any
capability gate (the same honest D8 model as the worker, just earlier), so a
plugin with build steps always prompts at install, even when it requests no
capabilities, and discloses the commands verbatim; `--yes` consents to both.
And a build that runs `pip install` pulls dependency bytes the source tree hash
does not attest; a featured plugin should pin them (for example a hash-locked
`requirements.txt`). First-class dependency and release-binary attestation are
deferred.

## Capabilities and grants (#2093)

Static contributions are not capabilities; a theme or a command needs no
approval. A capability gates runtime access to a resource that can affect user
data, host state, the OS, or the network. The v1 set
(`aoe_plugin_api::KNOWN_CAPABILITIES`): `runtime.worker`, `session.read`,
`session.write`, `config.read`, `config.write`, `process.spawn`, `net`,
`fs.read`, `fs.write`, `clipboard.read`, `clipboard.write`, `notifications`. A
plugin's own declared settings need no `config.*`; that gates host/global or
other-plugin config.

Capabilities are open strings (`CapabilityId`), so a follow-up can add one
without an `api_version` bump. An unknown capability still parses (forward
compatibility) but is rejected at install (`unsupported capability; upgrade
aoe`), never silently granted.

A grant (`PluginConfig.grant`, in `config.toml`) records the capabilities the
user approved and is pinned to the `sha256` of the installed manifest bytes
(`PluginManifest::hash_bytes`). The registry treats a community plugin as
active only when enabled AND the grant covers the installed manifest (same hash,
all declared capabilities present). A changed manifest, hence a changed hash or
capability set, invalidates the grant: the plugin stays installed but inactive
(`needs_reapproval`) until `aoe plugin update` re-prompts and re-approves.
Builtins are first-party, auto-granted, and never store a grant.

## External install, trust, and the lockfile (#2093)

`aoe plugin install <source>` installs an external plugin under
`<app_dir>/plugins/<id>/`; `aoe plugin` stays reserved for management (D4), so
there is no web install path. A source is a `gh:owner/repo[@ref]` slug or a
local directory (`src/plugin/source.rs`).

`src/plugin/fetch.rs` stages a plugin before install. A GitHub source is
`git clone`d (shallow when possible, a full clone plus checkout for a commit
ref), the exact commit is resolved, and `.git` is stripped; the clone base
defaults to `https://github.com` and is overridable via `AOE_GITHUB_CLONE_BASE`
(a GitHub Enterprise host, or a local `file://` base in tests). A local source
is copied (minus `.git` and symlinks). When the manifest declares a
`release-binary` runtime, the matching release asset for the host platform
(`${os}`/`${arch}`/`${version}` in the asset template) is downloaded via the
GitHub client and unpacked (raw or `.tar.gz`) into the tree, made executable.
The staging tree lives under the plugins dir so the final move into place is an
atomic same-filesystem rename.

Trust is host-assigned (`TrustLevel`): `builtin` (compiled in, auto-granted) or
`community` (external, capabilities gated). An external plugin whose id sits in
a reserved namespace (`aoe.*` / `agent-of-empires.*`, lifted only by featured
verification in #2364) or collides with a builtin is rejected at install and
skipped at load.

`plugins.lock` (`<app_dir>/plugins.lock`, TOML, keyed by id, deterministic and
timestamp-free like `Cargo.lock`) records each external plugin's resolved
identity: source slug, requested ref, resolved commit, version, manifest hash,
tree hash (see below), trust, and (for a release-binary) the release tag, asset
name, and asset sha256. `lock_version` is 2; a `tree_hash`-less v1 lock still
reads (the field defaults) and is repopulated on the next install/update.

## Integrity hashing and the featured index (#2364)

`plugin::integrity::tree_hash` is a deterministic `sha256:<hex>` over a plugin's
source tree. Files are sorted by their forward-slash relative path and hashed
under a versioned header (`aoe-plugin-tree-hash-v1`) as `file\0<path>\0<len>
<content>`. `.git` is skipped (it is stripped from an installed tree); a symlink
or non-UTF-8 path is a hard error so nothing installed escapes the hash. File
mode is excluded for cross-platform determinism, and `git clone` runs with
`core.autocrlf=false` so line endings never differ by platform. The hash is
computed over the staged source **before** any release-binary worker is
injected, so an author's `aoe plugin hash <checkout>` reproduces the
install-time value; the downloaded worker stays pinned separately by the lock's
`asset_sha256`.

`plugins/featured.toml` is the curated index, compiled into the binary. Each
entry pins one vetted release per plugin id to its `{source, tree_hash}`: a
maintainer's attestation that this exact tree was reviewed. When a plugin id
appears in the index, install and update **refuse** unless the fetched source
slug (case-insensitive) and tree hash both match the pin, and a release-binary
manifest is refused outright (its worker bytes are not covered by the tree hash
yet). A featured-verified install is the one case allowed to claim a reserved
(`aoe.*` / `agent-of-empires.*`) namespace; a builtin-id collision is always
rejected. In debug builds `AOE_FEATURED_INDEX_PATH` overrides the embedded index
for tests; a release binary always uses the compiled-in index, since the curated
set is a root of trust and must not be redefinable by the environment.

Every surface (CLI `aoe plugin list` / `info`, the TUI plugin manager, the web
Plugins panel) shows a `ValidationState`: `builtin`, `featured`, `community` (an
unvetted GitHub install), or `local` (a local-directory install). `featured` is
re-derived live at load (the id is in the embedded index and the on-disk tree
hashes to the pin), not trusted from the lockfile, since that same derivation
gates the reserved-namespace lift and the lockfile is user-writable; `community`
vs `local` is derived from the install source. The lockfile records the tree
hash and the install-time `trust` as a resolved record, but the load path does
not depend on them for validation. The recompute is cheap (only ids the index
names, and a featured plugin ships no release-binary, so its installed tree
equals its source tree). The manifest-hash grant check still catches a community
plugin tampered after install.

`aoe plugin hash <dir>` prints the tree hash for a plugin directory so an author
can produce the value a maintainer pins. Run it on a clean checkout.

## Tier 0 contribution registries (#2094)

Tier 0 wires a plugin's declarative manifest contributions into the host's
registries, with no plugin code execution (that is the Tier 1 host, #2095). Four
registries consume the manifest:

### Settings

A plugin's `[[settings]]` are typed: `type` (`string` / `bool` / `integer` /
`select`), with `options`, `min`/`max`, a `default`, and `advanced`. The host
maps each to its single-source settings schema as a virtual `plugin:<id>`
section. `settings_schema::runtime_schema()` returns the static core schema plus
those sections; `GET /api/settings/schema` serves it, the server validates
PATCHes against it (`validate_patch_with`), and the TUI/web render it through the
same generic field path as core settings. The API/validation layer speaks the
flat `plugin:<id>.<key>` shape; only the merge boundary translates to the on-disk
storage path `plugins.<id>.settings.<key>` (`settings_schema::plugin`). Plugin
settings are global-only at Tier 0 (not profile-overridable). In the TUI they
render read-only under the Plugins tab; edit them from the web dashboard or
`aoe settings`.

A manifest may also declare a *default* override for a core setting via
`[setting_defaults]` (keyed by the core `section.field`).
`settings_schema::resolve` returns the effective value, its source, and the full
candidate chain; `aoe settings explain <key>` and `GET /api/settings/resolved`
surface it.

The effective value of a core key at Tier 0 is the user's value (when it differs
from the baseline default), else the core schema default. A plugin's
`setting_defaults` override is included in the candidate chain so it is
observable, but it is NOT applied at runtime yet, so it never reports as the
effective `source`: nothing layers it during real `Config` load/merge, so every
core consumer still reads the struct default. The runtime host applies these
overrides for real (#2095); until then a `plugin_default` candidate is
"declared, not yet in effect". A plugin's own setting layers stored value >
manifest default. "Highest priority" (for the candidate ordering) is
active-plugin order, builtins first.

### Themes

A plugin's `[[themes]]` (`name`, `path`) add theme TOMLs to the picker. Each
`path` is resolved under the plugin's install directory (absolute or
parent-escaping paths are rejected); precedence is builtin > user custom >
plugin, so a plugin can never shadow a builtin or a user theme.

### Keybinds

A plugin's `[[keybinds]]` resolve through a merged resolver
(`tui::home::bindings::resolve_action`): the static core table is tried first and
always shadows a plugin binding on the same chord; active plugins' keybinds are
consulted only after. A resolved plugin keybind is inspectable but not runnable
at Tier 0 (it shows a "needs the plugin runtime" notice); `aoe plugin info` lists
a plugin's keybinds and flags any chord core shadows. Execution lands with #2095.

### CLI grafting

Active plugins' `[[commands]]` are grafted onto the derived clap tree at runtime
(`cli::graft`), so they appear in `aoe --help` and parse. Core commands always
win a name conflict. Dispatch tries the core derive first; a grafted command
falls through to the plugin dispatcher, which at Tier 0 reports that running it
needs the runtime (#2095).

## Tier 1 worker host (#2095)

The worker host runs inside the `aoe serve` daemon (it is `serve`-gated, like
`aoe.web`), because the host API it exposes reads and writes the event store and
session storage the daemon owns. A TUI-only build has no host. The daemon builds
one `PluginHost` at startup, launches a worker for every active plugin that
declares a `[runtime]`, and reaps them all on shutdown
(`AppState.plugin_host`, `src/server/mod.rs`).

### Launching a worker, language-agnostically

The host, not the plugin, decides how to resolve and execute a worker.
`src/plugin/launch.rs` turns a `LoadedPlugin` into a `ResolvedLaunch { program,
args, cwd, env }`, dispatched off the `[runtime]` kind in a single `match`.
Adding a new runtime kind later is a new arm there; the supervisor and the
transport only ever see a `ResolvedLaunch`, so nothing downstream changes.

- `command`: `argv[0]` resolves on `PATH` via `which` when it is a bare name (an
  interpreter or system tool like `python3` / `uv`), or relative to the plugin
  directory when it contains a separator (an in-tree script or binary, for
  example a build-produced `.venv/bin/worker`), verified executable. Absolute
  and parent-traversal paths are rejected. The same policy resolves each
  `[[runtime.build]]` step at install time; a plugin's own entrypoint should be
  plugin-relative so the daemon's PATH never decides whether it launches.
- `release-binary`: the per-platform binary that installation already placed in
  the plugin directory.

A missing runtime fails loudly with an actionable hint naming the program (and,
for a binary, the host `os-arch`), matching the project's error-with-hint style.
Filesystem and `PATH` probing go through a `LaunchResolver` trait so the
resolution policy is unit-tested with no real filesystem.

Builtins do not declare a `[runtime]` in this release, so `resolve_launch`
returns `Err(LaunchError::NoRuntime)` for them. The `aoe __plugin-worker`
self-exec path for a builtin worker, and the worker-side SDK, arrive with the
first builtin worker that needs them; shipping them now would be unused code.

### Transport and supervision

A worker is an executable speaking newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0
(`src/plugin/protocol.rs`) over its stdio: it writes one request object per line
to stdout and reads one response per line on stdin. The host is the server. Any
language that speaks this wire is a valid worker.

The worker is a child owned by the daemon, not a detached process (this is the
ACP supervision model minus its persistence half). There is no socket, no
on-disk runner record, and no reattach: a plugin worker is a stateless
transformer over a host-owned event stream, so surviving a daemon restart would
only strand it with a stale view. The daemon dies, its workers die, a fresh
daemon respawns them. What is kept from ACP: process-group reaping (a worker
that forks helpers is torn down whole), a per-worker respawn budget so a crash
loop does not spin, and a concurrency cap. The worker's stderr drains to
`<app_dir>/plugin-workers/<id>.log`.

### Capability-gated host API

Each host method maps to a capability the plugin declared and was granted; the
middleware refuses an undeclared or ungranted call before the method runs
(`src/plugin/host_api.rs`). No new capabilities are introduced; the v1 methods
reuse the existing taxonomy:

| Method | Capability |
| --- | --- |
| `events.publish` / `events.subscribe` | `runtime.worker` |
| `session.meta.get` | `session.read` |
| `session.meta.set` / `session.meta.cas` | `session.write` |
| `sessions.list` | `session.read` |
| `config.get` | `runtime.worker` |

`events.*` run over a shared plugin event bus (a `plugin_host` schema on the
durable event-log substrate, `src/events/`); `subscribe { topics, after_seq }`
is a replay-after-cursor read, so a worker polls forward from the last seq it
saw. Session metadata is always read and written under the calling plugin's own
`plugin_meta[<plugin-id>]` slot: the worker sends only a `key`, never another
plugin's id, so one plugin cannot reach another's data. A `session.meta.cas`
that loses returns the current value rather than clobbering it. Writes go
through `Storage`'s cross-process lock, so the daemon picks them up on its next
session reload (eventual consistency, not a live push).

`config.get { key }` returns the value at `plugins.<plugin-id>.settings.<key>`
for the calling plugin's own id, so a worker reads back the settings the user
edited on the TUI/web surfaces, falling back to its own default when the key is
unset (the call returns null). The id is the caller's own, never a request
parameter, so a plugin can only read its own table. Reading one's own declared
settings needs no `config.*` capability: `config.read` / `config.write` gate
host/global or other-plugin configuration, which no host method exposes yet, so
`config.get` rides on `runtime.worker` like `events.*`.

### Sandboxing

`SandboxBackend` (`src/plugin/sandbox.rs`) is the seam between a resolved launch
and the spawn. The only v1 backend is `NoSandbox`, which runs the worker as an
ordinary child. Per D8 this is honest, not complete: capability gating at the
host API boundary stops a cooperative plugin from overreaching, but a granted
worker has no OS-level isolation, so an adversarial plugin is not contained. The
capability grant prompt states this on every install. Restricted-environment,
landlock, and `sandbox-exec` backends land later behind the same trait, with no
change to the resolver or the supervisor.

## What comes next

Each deferred piece returns as its own PR once the core is proven: the Tier 0
contribution registries and the command/keybind/UI surfaces (issues 2094 and
2366), the builtin worker self-exec path and worker SDK (with the first builtin
worker that needs them), and the discovery / featured supply-chain layer with
integrity hashing (issues 2364 and 2365). Pinning a featured plugin's
release-binary asset hash in `featured.toml` (so a featured worker is attested,
not just its source) is a follow-up; today a release-binary plugin cannot be
featured.
