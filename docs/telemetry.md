# Telemetry

Agent of Empires can send **anonymous, opt-in** usage telemetry so the
maintainers can answer basic product questions (how many installs are active,
how many sessions people keep open, which agents/models/platforms matter, TUI
vs web). It is designed to be conservative: **off by default**, no PII, no
content, and it honors `DO_NOT_TRACK`.

## What is sent

Only when you opt in, and only aggregate counts. Two event kinds, both with a
closed, versioned schema (see `src/telemetry/events.rs`):

- **`process_start`** on boot: surface (`cli` / `tui` / `serve`), aoe version,
  OS, and CPU arch. The `cli` surface is throttled to at most once per install
  per day, so scripting `aoe` in a loop never floods the endpoint. The long-lived
  `tui` and `serve` surfaces emit one per launch (not throttled), so a restart is
  visible; a pathological crash-loop is absorbed by the gateway rather than a
  local cap.
- **`usage_snapshot`** from the TUI and `aoe serve`, on start and then about
  every 12 hours, with a small random jitter on the period so installs that boot
  together don't snapshot in lockstep. It is a point-in-time summary of the
  current install, never a stream of actions:
  - how many sessions exist and how many are running / idle / errored,
  - how many use a sandbox, the cockpit, or yolo mode,
  - how many sessions are currently pinned, snoozed, or archived (a
    point-in-time count of the session-organization states, not how often
    those actions were taken),
  - a per-substrate census: each session is classified into exactly one of
    `local` / `worktree` / `workspace` / `sandbox` / `scratch` (a closed
    five-way vocabulary), so the counts partition the session total and answer
    "of N sessions, how many are worktree vs local vs sandbox vs ...". All five
    keys are always present. This is orthogonal to the sandbox count above: a
    sandboxed worktree counts as `worktree` here yet still in the sandbox count,
    so the `sandbox` bucket means "sandboxed and not also one of the others",
    not "all sandboxed sessions",
  - a per-agent and per-model-family count (e.g. `{claude: 3, codex: 1}`),
  - how many sessions were created since the last snapshot, a trend counter so
    short-lived sessions that start and end between two snapshots are still
    counted (populated by `aoe serve`; the TUI reports `0`),
  - which opt-in features are turned on (see "Feature flags" below),
  - which surfaces were opened since the last snapshot, as a `usage_seen` map
    of allowlisted signal name to open-count (see "Usage signals" below),
  - for `aoe serve` only, how the daemon is deployed, decided once at launch:
    its auth mode (`token`, `passphrase`, or `none`) and its exposure mode
    (`tunnel` for a Cloudflare quick or named tunnel, `tailscale` for a
    Tailscale Funnel, or `local`). These are coarse enums only; the TUI reports
    neither, since it hosts no server.

In practice that is a handful of small (well under 1 KB) requests per active
install per day. There is no offline buffering, so a flaky network drops events
rather than building a backlog; the only retry is coarse (see "Failure
isolation" below).

Every agent and model string passes through a sanitizer
(`src/telemetry/sanitize.rs`) that coerces it to a fixed allowlist: a custom
agent command becomes `custom`, an unrecognized model becomes `other`. **Raw
commands, file paths, titles, branch names, group paths, and prompts are never
sent.**

### Feature flags

The snapshot includes a small `features` map (allowlisted feature name ->
on/off) so we can see which opt-in features installs actually turn on. It is
driven by a registry in `src/telemetry/features.rs`: tracking a newly gated
feature is one entry there (name + how to read it from config), not a schema
change. The key set is fixed and the values are booleans, so a flag can never
carry a path or name, and the gateway forwards only this allowlisted shape.

The values reflect the **global** config (the install default), not any single
profile's effective config. It is an install-level default-adoption signal;
since sessions can run under arbitrary profiles whose overrides are not folded
in here, per-session usage is reported separately by the session counts above.

### Usage signals

The snapshot also includes a `usage_seen` map (allowlisted signal name ->
open-count) so we can see which surfaces installs actually use within a window,
for example `{web: 3, cockpit: 1}`. It is driven by a registry in
`src/telemetry/usage_signals.rs`: instrumenting a new surface is one entry there
(its short name), not a schema change. The key set is fixed and the values are
counts, so a signal can never carry a path or free text, and the gateway
forwards only this allowlisted shape. The web dashboard reports an open by
pinging `POST /api/telemetry/seen`; an unregistered name is rejected. The TUI
never hosts the web surfaces, so it reports the map zeroed.

## What is never sent

Prompts, file or project paths, session titles, branch names, group paths,
custom command lines, model strings, hostnames, usernames, or anything derived
from them. For `aoe serve`, the deployment-mode signals carry only the coarse
auth and exposure enums above: never a tunnel name, named-tunnel hostname,
`.ts.net` URL, auth token, or passphrase. The install id is a random UUID
generated locally on opt-in; it is never derived from hostname, username, MAC,
or filesystem.

## Anonymous install id

Counting distinct installs needs a stable id. On opt-in, aoe generates a random
`uuid::Uuid::new_v4()` and stores it in `<app_dir>/telemetry.json` (owner-only).
Updates to that file are serialized with an advisory lock (a `.telemetry.lock`
sidecar) so concurrent `aoe` processes (TUI, CLI, `aoe serve`) can't clobber each
other's writes. It is kept **out of `config.toml`** on purpose, since people
routinely paste their config into bug reports. Opting out deletes the file; `aoe telemetry
reset-id` rotates it. Resetting mints a brand-new id, so that install then
counts as a new one in the aggregate distinct-install and retention numbers;
only reset if you actually want to disassociate from prior counts.

## Controlling it

Telemetry is **off by default**. Turn it on or off in any surface:

- **CLI**: `aoe telemetry status | enable | disable | reset-id`
- **TUI**: Settings → System → Telemetry
- **Web dashboard**: Settings → Telemetry, or the one-time consent prompt shown
  on first load

New users also see a telemetry pane in the first-run walkthrough; users who
finished the walkthrough before telemetry existed get a one-time opt-in popup.

### `DO_NOT_TRACK`

If the `DO_NOT_TRACK` environment variable is set to `1` / `true` / `yes`,
telemetry is suppressed absolutely: nothing is sent and no install id is
generated, regardless of the config flag. Every surface shows this suppressed
state explicitly rather than silently ignoring it.

## Failure isolation

Sends are best-effort with a hard ~2s timeout and every error is swallowed
(logged only at `debug`, `target: "telemetry"`). Telemetry never blocks, stalls
on exit, or crashes the tool. There is no offline buffering.

A send counts as delivered only on a confirmed `2xx`: a transport error or a
non-success HTTP status (for example a rejected key or a schema rejection at the
gateway) is treated as a failure, not a silent success. Signals are not consumed
until delivery is confirmed, so a failed send does not silently drop them:

- the CLI `process_start` daily slot is claimed only on a confirmed send, so a
  failed send leaves it open for the next invocation to retry (bounded to once
  per hour so a down endpoint cannot make every `aoe` invocation re-send);
- the serve `usage_seen` open counts and the session-create counter are cleared
  only after a confirmed snapshot send, decremented by exactly what was reported,
  so a failed snapshot keeps them for the next one instead of losing that
  window's signal.

This is coarse, last-write retry, not a durable queue: periodic snapshots are
still point-in-time, and a snapshot identical to the last confirmed one is
deduped rather than re-sent.

## Backend

Opted-in events go to the collection gateway at
`https://telemetry.agent-of-empires.com/v1/ingest`. The gateway validates the
envelope and re-sanitizes every field as a defense-in-depth backstop, then
folds the payload into aggregate counts. `AOE_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT` overrides the
target (point it at a local sink to see exactly what is sent). A compiled-in
`X-Telemetry-Key` header lets the gateway drop unkeyed drive-by traffic; it is
visible in the source, so it is noise-shedding, not authentication.

The web dashboard never posts to the gateway directly (that would leak the
browser's IP and User-Agent); it reports local state to `aoe serve`, which owns
the install id and does all sending.

**Schema contract.** The wire format is the flat, closed schema in
`src/telemetry/events.rs`, mirrored by the gateway. New fields must be counts,
booleans, or short identifier-like strings (and the allowlisted bucket maps:
per-agent, per-model-family, and per-substrate); the gateway drops free text,
paths, branch-name-like strings, and any nested object, so anything richer than
a count or flag will not survive ingest.
