//! ACP client wrapper.
//!
//! aoe is the *client* in ACP terms; the agent (claude-code, aoe-agent,
//! gemini, etc.) is the *server*. The client sends `initialize`,
//! `session/new`, `session/prompt` and handles incoming `session/update`
//! notifications and `session/request_permission` requests.
//!
//! Architecture: spawn the agent subprocess, build a `ByteStreams`
//! transport over its stdio, run `Client.builder().connect_with(...)` on
//! a background tokio task. The task drives a long-lived loop:
//! initialize once, create one ACP session, then pump commands from an
//! mpsc channel into ACP requests until shutdown.
