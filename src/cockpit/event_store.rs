//! Disk-backed event log for cockpit sessions.
//!
//! Every event published through `ChannelSink` is appended here so the
//! conversation transcript survives page reloads, session switches,
//! and `aoe serve` restarts. One row per `(session_id, seq)` with a
//! per-session retention cap; older events are pruned on insert once
//! the row count exceeds the cap.
//!
//! ## How replay flows
//!
//! - **WebSocket on-connect drain.** The client passes the `lastSeq` it
//!   has cached (or 0 on first connect) as a query param to
//!   `/sessions/{id}/cockpit/ws`. The handler reads
//!   `replay_from(session_id, since)` out of this store and pushes
//!   those frames before forwarding the live broadcast, closing the
//!   subscribe-gap race that would otherwise drop the agent's first
//!   chunks on a fast page load.
//! - **Snapshot endpoint.** `GET /cockpit/replay?since=N` reads the
//!   same data path, used by the React reducer when it sees a `lagged`
//!   notice from the WS to catch up missed frames.
//! - **Startup hydration.** On boot, `next_seqs` is rehydrated from
//!   `MAX(seq) + 1` per session so post-restart writes don't collide
//!   with pre-restart rows via `INSERT OR IGNORE`.
//!
//! ## How it relates to agent-side memory
//!
//! This store only persists the *UI transcript*. The model's
//! conversation context across `aoe serve` restarts is a separate
//! mechanism in `supervisor.rs`: when the agent advertises
//! `agent_capabilities.load_session = true` on the ACP `initialize`
//! response, the supervisor stores the agent-assigned `session_id` on
//! `Instance.cockpit_acp_session_id` and uses `session/load` on
//! subsequent spawns instead of `session/new`. If `session/load`
//! fails, the stored id is cleared and a `SessionContextReset` event
//! is published; the UI renders an amber callout in the transcript so
//! the user knows prior turns are no longer in the model's context.
//!
//! The bundled `aoe-agent` does not yet advertise `load_session`, so
//! its UI transcript replays from this store on restart but the model
//! itself starts fresh each spawn (tracked in #1005).
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! Per-session rows are dropped on session delete and on
//! `cockpit_disable` (the master switch turning off, or a per-session
//! opt-out). The connection has WAL mode enabled so the publish path
//! and the replay endpoint don't block each other under load.
