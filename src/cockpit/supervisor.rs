//! Owns a per-aoe-process map of session_id -> AcpClient handles. Spawns

//! notifications for ApprovalRequested events.
//!
//! Watchdog: when an agent's ACP connection task ends (subprocess exit,
//! transport break) the drain task respawns it. Up to
//! `MAX_RESPAWNS_IN_WINDOW` respawns are allowed inside `RESTART_WINDOW`;

//!
//! Consumer side: `Supervisor::send_prompt(session_id, text)` and
