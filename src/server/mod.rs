//    invoke this helper. They differ in cadence, in what they do BEFORE
//    calling it (tmux scrape lives only in `status_poll_loop`), and in
//    the StatusSource they pass.
// 2. `merge_runtime_fields` is mandatory per-id. Skipping it wipes the
//    five #[serde(skip)] runtime fields (`last_error_check`,
//    `last_start_time`, `last_error`, `session_id_poller`,
//    `retroactive_capture_excludes`) that disk reload zeroes by design.
// 3. `merge_runtime_fields` does NOT carry `status`, `last_accessed_at`,
//    or `idle_entered_at`. Those three are handled per StatusSource:
//    DiskOnly takes prior.status and `prior.idle_entered_at.or(fresh.idle_entered_at)`,
//    TmuxApplied takes fresh's. `last_accessed_at` is monotonic-max
//    regardless.
// 4. The acp overlay filter is `inst.is_structured()`, never the lazy
//    ACP session id. The latter is set lazily by the ACP handshake
//    and is None for newly-spawned acp sessions; using it as the
//    filter would silently drop overlay coverage for pre-handshake
//    rows.
// 5. `prior_by_id` is built with `.drain(..)` once, then read with
//    `.get()` rather than `.remove()` in the merge loop, so the same map is
//    still populated when `apply_acp_overlay_inplace` runs.
// 6. Polling is canonical. The watcher path
//    adds latency reduction; correctness still holds when it fails.
// 7. `status_poll_loop` and `disk_watcher_consumer` may interleave
//    per-tick; both serialise on `state.instances.write().await`. A
//    DiskOnly merge between a TmuxApplied write and a subsequent tmux
//    scrape can briefly carry the prior status; it self-corrects on
//    the next 2s tick. Polling is canonical (invariant 6) so this is
//    acceptable.

/// Reload `state.instances` by merging caller-supplied `fresh` against the
/// prior in-memory snapshot per id, then reapplying the acp overlay.

/// diffs BEFORE invoking the helper.
/// Snapshot of the prior in-memory `state.instances` keyed by id, used
/// for per-id merging in `reload_state_instances_from_disk` and the
/// acp-overlay pass. Intentionally exposes only `drain_from` and `get`;
/// no `remove` method, because invariant 5 of the merge contract
/// requires the same map to be populated when
/// `apply_acp_overlay_inplace` runs after the merge loop. The compiler
/// rejects any future `.remove()` call instead of relying on prose.
