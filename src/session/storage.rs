//! Session storage - JSON file persistence with in-process and cross-process
//! locking.
//!
//! `Storage` serialises read-modify-write cycles via two layers:
//!
//! 1. **In-process per-profile mutex** (one `Arc<Mutex<()>>` per profile name,
//!    registered process-wide). Performance + observability layer, not a
//!    correctness primitive on the supported platforms (Linux, macOS): a
//!    userspace mutex is roughly an order of magnitude cheaper than the
//!    flock syscall on the uncontended path, and same-thread re-entry
//!    deadlocks here immediately rather than via a 50ms polling loop on
//!    the flock. Removing this layer would still produce correct on-disk
//!    state because `fs2::FileExt` maps to `flock(2)`, whose locks are
//!    scoped to the open file description (OFD) on **both** Linux and
//!    macOS/BSD. (A common misconception is that macOS `flock` is
//!    process-scoped; it is not. Apple's flock(2) man page and
//!    `xnu/bsd/kern/kern_descrip.c::sys_flock` key the lock on
//!    `fp->fp_glob`, the open file description, identical in effect to
//!    Linux's documented OFD scoping.) Every `Storage::update` opens its
//!    own fd via `OpenOptions::open`, so two `Storage` handles in the
//!    same process get distinct OFDs and `flock` between them conflicts
//!    just as it does between processes. If AoE is ever ported to a
//!    platform whose underlying lock primitive is process-scoped (e.g.
//!    POSIX `fcntl(F_SETLK)` advisory locks, or certain Windows backends
//!    that key on the `HANDLE` rather than the open file description),
//!    this mutex becomes load-bearing and must not be removed without
//!    re-establishing intra-process exclusion.
//! 2. **Cross-process advisory `flock(2)`** on a sidecar lock file
//!    (`<profile_dir>/.storage.lock` for sessions+groups,
//!    `<app_dir>/.workspace-ordering.lock` for ordering). Sole guarantor
//!    of write serialisation; `atomic_write` separately guarantees that
//!    lock-free readers observe a consistent JSON document. Every mutator
//!    holds the flock from before `load` until after `atomic_write`.
//!    Polled `fs2::FileExt::try_lock_exclusive` with a 50ms backoff so
//!    that a wait longer than 1s fires a single `tracing::warn`; the
//!    kernel releases the lock on process exit, including SIGKILL, so a
//!    crashed peer cannot wedge other aoe processes. Mirrors the pattern
//!    already used by `recovery.rs` and `logging.rs`.
//!
//! All mutation goes through `update` (load -> mutate -> save under both
//! locks). `save_workspace_ordering` is private and only consumed by
//! `update_workspace_ordering` internally; the per-profile `save` /
//! `save_groups` helpers were removed entirely. This keeps it structurally
//! impossible to bypass the locks.
//!
//! Lock-ordering rule across the process: server callers MUST drop
//! `AppState.instances` (tokio RwLock) before acquiring `Storage`'s
//! per-profile mutex via `tokio::task::spawn_blocking(... storage.update)`.
//! The flock can park on a wedged peer for arbitrary time; holding the
//! tokio RwLock across the wait would block every other reader/writer of
//! `AppState.instances` and park the worker thread. The cross-process
//! `flock` is acquired AFTER the in-process mutex and released BEFORE it
//! (RAII drop order). The closure passed to `update` is
//! `FnOnce(...) -> Result<R>` and cannot await, so `std::sync::Mutex` is
//! safe across the body even on the tokio runtime.
//!
//! Closures must remain CPU/memory only (no network, no user input, no tmux
//! work). A closure that hangs holds both layers indefinitely and blocks
//! every peer process. The same hung-hook caveat documented in
//! `recovery.rs` applies here.
//!
//! `update_workspace_ordering` and `Storage::update` must NOT be called from
//! inside each other's closures. They use distinct lock files but acquiring
//! both in different orders across processes would deadlock cross-process.
//! Today no caller does this; this comment is the invariant.
