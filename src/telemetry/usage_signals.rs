//! Registry of usage "feature X was used this window" signals.
//!
//! This is the single, auditable place that decides which usage signals the
//! snapshot may carry. The result is a map keyed by a **fixed set of short
//! signal names** (the allowlist), so it can never carry a path, name, or
//! other free-form value, and the gateway forwards it as allowlisted
//! short-name -> count while dropping anything else.
//!
//! It mirrors [`super::features`] (install-level adoption) but tracks a
//! different lifecycle: `features` is rebuilt from config on every snapshot,
//! whereas these counters accumulate browser pings across a window and are
//! decremented by exactly what a confirmed snapshot reported. Tracking a newly
//! instrumented surface is one entry in [`USAGE_SIGNALS`]: the
//! `/api/telemetry/seen` endpoint, the daemon aggregate, and the snapshot all
//! derive from this slice, so no other code changes.
