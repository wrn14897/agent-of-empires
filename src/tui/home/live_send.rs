//! Live-send mode: a "feels-attached" alternative to the compose dialog.
//!
//! When a user presses `Tab` on a runnable session, the home view installs
//! a `LiveSendState` and routes every subsequent key event through this
//! module's translator. Each translation produces a `tmux send-keys` call
//! against the target pane: plain characters go literally, every other
//! key (arrows, Esc, Tab, modifier combos) goes by tmux key name with
//! `C-` / `M-` prefixes. The user exits with one of the configured
//! exit chords (default: `Ctrl+q`).
//!
//! Exit chord configuration: the user picks a comma-separated list
//! of chord specs (`C-q`, `M-x`, `F12`, …) via settings. Default is
//! `C-q` alone: mobile-friendly, passes through Termius and other
//! restrictive SSH clients, and leaves every other chord available
//! to pass through to the agent. Whichever chord in the configured
//! list fires first ends live mode. The cost of binding a chord is
//! that it can't be sent through to the agent; users who need `C-q`
//! itself to reach the agent configure a different exit.
//!
//! Trade-offs vs. a compose dialog:
//! - No echo, no inline editing, no review step. The preview pane is the
//!   only feedback channel; users who need multi-line composition or want
//!   to proofread voice/dictation should use the compose dialog on `M`.
//! - Each coalesced keystroke run becomes one `tmux send-keys`
//!   subprocess. A long-lived `tmux -C` control-mode connection was
//!   tried (#1485) to avoid that fork cost on mobile, but the
//!   connection turned out to be unreliable on macOS tmux 3.x: it
//!   EOF'd within milliseconds of spawn, leaving us paying the spawn
//!   cost while never benefiting from the connection. Forking per
//!   batch is the simpler, more portable model; the per-batch fork
//!   cost is bounded by user typing speed (held keys / pastes
//!   coalesce into one fork) and is invisible on a laptop.
//!
//! Reserved (non-forwarded) chords:
//! - The configured exit chord list — exits live mode (see above).
//! - `Shift+PageUp` / `Shift+PageDown` — scroll the preview pane back
//!   through agent history without exiting. Matches the terminal-
//!   emulator convention. Bare `PageUp` / `PageDown` still passes
//!   through, so agents that page their own UI keep working.
//! - Mouse wheel over the preview pane — also scrolls the preview,
//!   handled by `handle_scroll_up` / `handle_scroll_down`.
