// Auto-launch decision table for the first-run tutorial. The run -> engine
// integration (rAF, lazy load, Joyride rendering, skip persistence) is covered
// by the live Playwright smoke; this locks the pure gating logic that live
// (desktop, first-run) cannot easily exercise: coarse-pointer and seen-flag
// suppression, and scope gating.
