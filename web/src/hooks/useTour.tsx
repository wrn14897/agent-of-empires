// First-run tutorial controller. Owns the tour's run state, the resolved step
// snapshot, and auto-launch policy. The "seen" flag is now persisted
// server-side (config.toml `app_state.has_seen_web_tour`) so a returning user
// on a new browser or device is not re-shown the tour; App owns the fetch and
// the write and feeds them in as `seen` / `seenKnown` / `onSeen`. The hook is
// engine-agnostic: the react-joyride coupling lives entirely in the lazy
// TourRunner, which is only mounted (and only downloaded) while a tour runs, so
// returning users never pay for the engine. App is the single consumer, so this
// is a plain hook returning the element to render rather than a context.
